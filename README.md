# Project-1

My first project for my full stack web development class. I have developed a blacksmithing website where you can order one of three types of weapons, and then one of four variations of that weapon.

Technologies used: html, css, and js.

### How to Use Site

1. Go to home page.

2. Click the catalogue button.

3. Find a desirable weapon and type to order.

4. Click the order button.

5. Fill out the order form and clarify any specifications.

6. Hit submit and wait 3-5 for Arnold to get back to you to confirm both the price and a mockup of the weapon desired.

### User Stories

As a survivalist I want to order a knife for an affordable price that I can rely on in the wild.

As a prop master I want to order a historically accurate weapon to use in a historical fiction production.

As a Live Action Role Player, I want to order a weapon to use while cosplaying my fictional character.

### Ideas for Future Improvement

1. Include more than 3 orderable weapons.

2. Include more than four optional varieties of the weapons.

3. Include a gallery of weapons made by Arnold for quality assurance.
